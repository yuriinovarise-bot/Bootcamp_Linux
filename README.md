# Bootcamp Linux Project

## Overview
This project is part of my Linux learning bootcamp.  
I practiced working with the Linux file system, text files, and basic Git/GitHub operations.

## What I did
- Created a project directory structure (`docs`, `src`, `bin`, `tests`).
- Created and edited a text file (`README.txt` â†’ `MANUAL.txt`).
- Practiced file operations: create, copy, rename, delete.
- Viewed and edited file contents with `cat`, `less`, and `nano`.
- Checked file size and permissions.
- Initialized a Git repository and uploaded it to GitHub.
